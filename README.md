This database design and implementation project for the Eco Voyage travel agency addressed identified needs by modernizing the management of reservations, customers, payments, and promotions.
Through a thorough needs analysis, we developed a robust conceptual model (CDM) and transformed it into a logical model (LDM) implemented in Oracle. The 16 tables created cover all business aspects,
from tour and destination management to discounts and specific fees. Triggers automate critical processes such as:
• Generating membership numbers based on client age.
• Calculating deposits and discounts (Club Select, early booking, etc.).
• Applying cancellation or modification fees, thus ensuring compliance with agency policies.
SQL queries provide operational tools to:
• Track pending payments and client reminders.
• Analyze cancellations and their financial impacts.
• Optimize escort allocation and tour planning.
This system offers an integrated, scalable, and reliable solution, facilitating the transition to digital management for Éco Voyage. It also paves the way for future expansions, such as an online platform 
or information terminals. Finally, the documentation provided (templates, scripts, user guide) ensures easy maintenance and handling by the agency's teams.

This work illustrates the importance of rigorous modeling and intelligent automation to transform operational challenges into opportunities for continuous improvement.
